      <div class="topic">Managing & Developing Is My Passion</div>
      <p>Hello,
		 My name is Aneesh. I am recently pursuing my Master's in MIS.
		 After completing my bachelor's in IT I began my career as a Programmer/Analyst at Bitwise.
		 I immediately discovered that I am a good match for leadership after working closely with the team lead and Operations manager. Constantly engaging with various clients and aiding them in resolving their problems has given me the confidence to communicate in varied ways. So, to gain professional knowledge and experience, I opted to pursue my master's degree. Working as an event planner for two different groups at our campus had piqued my curiosity. Since I started working at Bitwise, I've always been a multi-tasker because I was assigned to work on three projects simultaneously. So my skills are time management, multitasking, and people management. As a result, I believe I am an excellent fit for this position, where I can share my experience while also learning new abilities from a mentor.
		 I am highly passionate about this opportunity and joining your team to learn and get expertise in leadership skills.</p>
